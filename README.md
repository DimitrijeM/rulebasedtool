# Python Demo Project: Rule-based tool

---------------------

## Introduction

This project was developed as a quick demonstration of interesting libraries and ideas around a rule-based tool.

The project contains:
- GUI demos in TkInter
- ClipsPi demo
- Streamlit demo
- Web Api demo with Flask


# Requirements and Installation

To be able to run all the demos, please make sure you have installed all the libraries. The recommended option for this is to keep them in a virtual environment.
Inside the project, create virtualenv:
> python -m venv .venv

Then, activate the environment: If you are on Windows, you will use 
> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

On other OSes, you will use 
> source .venv/bin/activate

Once activated, you will see the name of the environment within the terminal. Then you can install requirements:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
